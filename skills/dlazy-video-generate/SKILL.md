# dlazy-video-generate

[English](./SKILL.md) · [中文](./SKILL-cn.md)

Video generation skill. Automatically selects the best dlazy CLI video model based on the prompt.

## Trigger Keywords

- generate video
- text to video
- animate image

## Authentication

All requests require a dLazy API key. The recommended way to authenticate is:

```bash
dlazy login
```

This runs a device-code flow (also works in remote shells) and **automatically saves your API key** to the local CLI config — no manual copy/paste required.

### Alternative: Set the Key Manually

If you already have an API key, you can save it directly:

```bash
dlazy auth set YOUR_API_KEY
```

The CLI saves the key in your user config directory (`~/.dlazy/config.json` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.dlazy\config.json` on Windows), with file permissions restricted to your OS user account. You can also supply the key per-invocation via the `DLAZY_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Getting Your API Key Manually

1. Sign in or create an account at [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com)
2. Go to [dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key](https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key)
3. Copy the key shown in the API Key section

Each key is scoped to your dLazy organization and can be **rotated or revoked at any time** from the same dashboard.




## About & Provenance

- **CLI source code**: [github.com/dlazyai/cli](https://github.com/dlazyai/cli)
- **Maintainer**: dlazyai
- **npm package**: `@dlazy/cli` (pinned to `1.0.9` in this skill's install spec)
- **Homepage**: [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com)

You can install on demand without persisting a global binary by running:

```bash
npx @dlazy/cli@1.0.9 <command>
```

Or, if you prefer a global install, the skill's `metadata.clawdbot.install` field declares the exact pinned version (`npm install -g @dlazy/cli@1.0.9`). Review the GitHub source before installing.

## How It Works

This skill is a thin client over the dLazy hosted API. When you invoke it:

- Prompts and parameters you provide are sent to the dLazy API endpoint (`api.dlazy.com`) for inference.
- Any local file paths you pass to image / video / audio fields are uploaded to dLazy's media storage (`files.dlazy.com`) so the model can read them — the same flow as any cloud-based generation API.
- Generated output URLs returned by the API are hosted on `files.dlazy.com`.

This is the standard SaaS pattern; the skill itself does not access network or filesystem resources beyond what the dLazy CLI already handles. See [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com) for the full service terms.

## Piping Between Commands

Every `dlazy` invocation prints a JSON envelope on stdout. Any flag value can be a **pipe reference** that pulls from the upstream command's envelope, so you can chain steps without copying URLs by hand.

| Reference          | Resolves to                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-`                | Upstream's natural value for this field (scalar or array)       |
| `@N`               | The N-th output's primary value (e.g. `@0` = first output url)  |
| `@N.<jsonpath>`    | Drill into the N-th output (`@0.url`, `@1.meta.fps`)            |
| `@*`               | All outputs' primary values as an array                         |
| `@stdin`           | The whole upstream JSON envelope                                |
| `@stdin:<jsonpath>` | Jsonpath into the whole envelope (`@stdin:result.outputs[0].url`) |

### Examples

```bash
# Generate an image and feed its url straight into image-to-video
dlazy seedream-4.5 --prompt "a red fox in snow" \
  | dlazy kling-v3 --image - --prompt "fox starts running"

# Generate an image, then add TTS narration over a still
dlazy seedream-4.5 --prompt "lighthouse at dawn" \
  | dlazy keling-tts --text "Welcome to the coast." --image @0.url

# Fan-out: pass every upstream output url into a batch step
dlazy seedream-4.5 --prompt "city skyline" --n 4 \
  | dlazy superres --images @*
```

> Required flags can be entirely sourced from the pipe — `--field -` satisfies the requirement when an upstream value exists. If stdin is empty, the CLI fails with `code: "no_stdin"`.

## Usage

This skill handles all video generation requests by selecting the best `dlazy` video model.

### Available Video Models

- `dlazy veo-3.1`, `dlazy veo-3.1-fast`: High-quality cinematic sequences.
- `dlazy sora-2`, `dlazy sora-2-pro`: Narrative clips.
- `dlazy kling-v3`, `dlazy kling-v3-omni`: General short clips.
- `dlazy seedance-1.5-pro`: Narrative shorts with transitions.
- `dlazy wan2.6-r2v`, `dlazy wan2.6-r2v-flash`: General/fast video production.
- `dlazy viduq2-i2v`, `dlazy jimeng-i2v-first`, `dlazy jimeng-i2v-first-tail`, `dlazy jimeng-dream-actor`, `dlazy jimeng-omnihuman-1.5`: Image-to-video, digital human, action transfer.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AGENT**:

1. Select the most appropriate video model.
2. Run \`dlazy <model_name> -h\` to check parameters.
3. Execute the command.

| 501  | Missing required parameter         | `error: required option '--prompt <prompt>' not specified`                                                               |
| 502  | Local file read error              | `Error: Image file/Video file not found: C:\path\to\your\file`                                                           |
| 503  | API request failed (no balance)    | `ok: false, code: "insufficient_balance"`                                                                                |
| 503  | API request failed (server error)  | `HTTP status code error (500 server crash)`                                                                              |
| 504  | Asynchronous task execution failed | `=== Generation Failed ===` / `{Specific error reason returned by backend, for example "Prompt violates safety policy"}` |

> **AGENT CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**:
>
> 1. If the execution result returns `code: "insufficient_balance"`, you MUST explicitly inform the user that their credits are insufficient and guide them to recharge: [https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/settings?tab=credits](https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/settings?tab=credits)
> 2. If the execution result returns `code: "unauthorized"` or indicates missing API key, you MUST inform the user to get their API key from [https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key](https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key) and save it using `dlazy auth set <key>` and resume the task.
